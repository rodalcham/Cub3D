# 2D Raycaster Game

A simple 2D raycasting engine inspired by classic games like **Wolfenstein 3D**. The game features dynamic lighting, texture rendering, and player movement in a 2D world.

## Features

- **Raycasting** for 2D rendering.
- Textures for walls, floors, and ceilings.
- Interactive elements such as a **minimap** and **dynamic player movement**.
- Smooth gameplay with **keyboard controls** for movement and direction changes.

## Requirements

To build and run the game, you need:

- **C Compiler** (e.g., `gcc`)
- **MLX Library** (MinilibX)
- A Unix-based system (Linux or macOS)
- Libraries: `pthread` and `math`

## Installation and Setup

Ensure the **MinilibX library** is installed. You can install it using your system's package manager or by downloading it from [MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).

Modify the `Makefile` if necessary to point to your MinilibX installation.

## Compilation

To compile the project, run:

```bash
make
```

This will produce an executable named `cub3D`.

## Running the Game

To start the game, provide a `.cub` file as input, which defines the map and textures:

```bash
./cub3D <map_file>.cub
```

- `<map_file>.cub`: The path to a `.cub` file that contains map details and texture paths.

### Example:

```bash
./cub3D maps/sample_map.cub
```

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D**: Move forward, backward, left, and right.
- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate the player view.
- **M**: Toggle the minimap.
- **ESC**: Exit the game.

## Notes

- The `.cub` file should specify textures for north, south, east, and west walls, along with colors for the ceiling and floor.
- Player starting position is defined in the map with characters like `N`, `S`, `E`, or `W`.
